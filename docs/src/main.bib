    abstract = {Several studies have focused attention on the crisis of the COVID- 19 pandemic and the impact on the traditional face-to-face teaching and learning activities across the globe. There is, however, little research regarding the platformisation of education with the aid of the learning management systems (LMSs) in the contexts of South African universities. With a thematic content analysis of the extant literature and a systematic review of universities' websites, this study explored and unearthed various LMS platforms which public universities in South Africa adopted and utilized before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and during the lockdown period. The findings revealed that the majority (46%) of South Africa's public universities used the Blackboard LMS while another 34 percent of the 26 universities used the Moodle LMS. The rest of the public universities in South Africa used one of the following LMS platforms: the Vula, Efundi, ClickUp, RUConnected, Sakai, SunLearn, Canvas, an},

    abstract = {As binaural audio continues to permeate immersive technologies, it is vital to develop a detailed understanding of the perceptual relevance of HRTFs. Previous research has explored the benefit of individual HRTFs with respect to localisation. However, localisation is only one metric with which it is possible to rate spatial audio. This paper evaluates the perceived timbral and spatial characteristics of both individual and non-individual HRTFs and compares the results to overall preference. To that end, the measurement and evaluation of a high-resolution multi-environment binaural Impulse Response database is presented for 20 subjects, including the KU100 and KEMAR binaural mannequins. Post-processing techniques, including low frequency compensation and diffuse field equalisation are discussed in relation to the 8802 unique HRTFs measured for each mannequin and 2818/2114 HRTFs measured for each human. Listening test results indicate that particular HRTF sets are preferred more generally by subjects over their own individual measurements.},

    abstract = {Phenomena involving vision with two eyes have been commented upon for several thousand years whereas those concerned with hearing with two ears have a much more recent history. Studies of binocular vision and binaural hearing are contrasted with respect to the singleness of the percept, experimental manipulations of dichoptic and dichotic stimuli, eye and ear dominance, spatial localisation, and the instruments used to stimulate the paired organs. One of the principal phenomena that led to studies of dichotic hearing was dichoptic colour mixing. There was similar disagreement regarding whether colours or sounds could be combined when presented to different paired organs. Direction and distance in visual localisation were analysed before those for auditory localisation, partly due to difficulties in controlling the stimuli. Instruments for investigating binocular vision, like the stereoscope and pseudoscope, were invented before those for binaural hearing, like the stethophone and pseu},

Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of playing the VAD game on sound localization performance under subjects’ own head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) and HRTFs fitted from those of 16 other adults. Participants performed sound localization tasks initially and 2 weeks later to show the effects. The VAD game players were of three groups, using own HRTFs, fitted HRTFs, and no playing (control). The VAD game-playing results revealed that: (1) the hit rate of the sound localization task for real sound sources increased approximately 20%; (2) the vertical and horizontal localization error decreased significantly; (3) sound localization performance using fitted HRTFs was similar to performance using own HRTFs. Follow-up tests revealed that transfer effects persisted more than 1 month, suggesting that the effects of playing the VAD game transfer to sound localization performance.}

The remaining four chapters in this comprehensive reference cover auditory research procedures and psychometric methods, spatial hearing with one sound source, spatial hearing with multiple sound sources and in enclosed spaces, and progress and trends from 1972 (the first German edition) to 1983 (the first English edition)—work that includes research on the physics of the external ear, and the application of signal processing theory to modeling the spatial hearing process.

State-of-the-art parametric methods should be flexible, able to handle a variety of input formats, either multichannel content or recordings coming from a variety of recording setups. Many methods in enhancement, up-mixing, and reproduction of recordings impose a model of one dominant directional source and some diffuse/ambient sound at each time-frequency tile. The extracted spatial parameters allow the whole arsenal of audio engineering tools for perceptual sound spatialization to be used optimally for a variety of target setups, such as appropriate panning functions, head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), and reverberation algorithms.}

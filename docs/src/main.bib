		Transfer effects of playing an auditory game with a virtual auditory display
		(VAD) were investigated. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of playing the
		VAD game on sound localization performance under subjects' own head-related
		transfer functions (HRTFs) and HRTFs fitted from those of 16 other adults.
		Participants performed sound localization tasks initially and 2 weeks later
		to show the effects. The VAD game players were of three groups, using own
		HRTFs, fitted HRTFs, and no playing (control). The VAD game-playing results
		revealed that: (1) the hit rate of the sound localization task for real sound
		sources increased approximately 20\%; (2) the vertical and horizontal
		localization error decreased significantly; (3) sound localization
		performance using fitted HRTFs was similar to performance using own HRTFs.
		Follow-up tests revealed that transfer effects persisted more than 1 month,
		suggesting that the effects of playing the VAD game transfer to sound
		localization performance.

		WebRTC comprises a set of technologies and standards that provide real-time

		communication in web applications and mobile devices. The perceived quality
		of WebRTC communication can be measured using quality of experience (QoE)
		indicators. QoE is defined as the degree of delight or annoyance of the user
		with an application or service. This paper is focused on the QoE assessment
		of WebRTC-based applications and its contribution is threefold. First, an
		analysis of how WebRTC topologies affect the quality perceived by users is
		provided. Second, a group of Key Performance Indicators for estimating the
		QoE of WebRTC users is proposed. Finally, a systematic survey of the
		literature on QoE assessment in the WebRTC arena is presented.

		As binaural audio continues to permeate immersive technologies, it is vital
		to develop a detailed understanding of the perceptual relevance of HRTFs.
		Previous research has explored the benefit of individual HRTFs with respect
		to localisation. However, localisation is only one metric with which it is
		possible to rate spatial audio. This paper evaluates the perceived timbral
		and spatial characteristics of both individual and non-individual HRTFs and
		compares the results to overall preference. To that end, the measurement and
		evaluation of a high-resolution multi-environment binaural Impulse Response
		database is presented for 20 subjects, including the KU100 and KEMAR binaural
		mannequins. Post-processing techniques, including low frequency compensation
		and diffuse field equalisation are discussed in relation to the 8802 unique
		HRTFs measured for each mannequin and 2818/2114 HRTFs measured for each
		human. Listening test results indicate that particular HRTF sets are
		preferred more generally by subjects over their own individual measurements.

		The field of spatial hearing has exploded in the decade or so since Jens

		mainly on the physics of spatial hearing), binaural technology (modeling
		speech enhancement by binaural hearing), and spatial sound-field mapping. The
		chapter also includes recent research on the precedence effect that provides
		clear experimental evidence that cognition plays a significant role in
		spatial hearing. The remaining four chapters in this comprehensive reference
		cover auditory research procedures and psychometric methods, spatial hearing
		with one sound source, spatial hearing with multiple sound sources and in
		enclosed spaces, and progress and trends from 1972 (the first German edition)
		to 1983 (the first English edition)--work that includes research on the
		physics of the external ear, and the application of signal processing theory

		This book provides readers with an overview of Cloud Computing, starting with
		historical background on mainframe computers and early networking protocols,
		leading to current concerns such as hardware and systems security,
		performance, emerging areas of IoT, Edge Computing etc. Readers will benefit
		from the in-depth discussion of cloud computing usage and the underlying
		architecture, with focus on best practices for using a dynamic cloud
		infrastructure, cloud operations management and cloud security. The authors
		explain carefully the ``why's and how's'' of Cloud Computing, so engineers
		will find this book and invaluable introduction to the topic.

		Spatial sound reproduction is mainly concerned with delivering appropriate
		spatial cues using a reproduction system, loudspeakers or headphones, in
		order to provide a convincing, immersive, and engaging aural experience,
		close to the intentions of the producer for a synthetic sound scene, or to
		the original experience for a recorded one. State-of-the-art parametric
		methods should be flexible, able to handle a variety of input formats, either
		multichannel content or recordings coming from a variety of recording setups.
		Many methods in enhancement, up-mixing, and reproduction of recordings impose
		a model of one dominant directional source and some diffuse/ambient sound at
		each time-frequency tile. The extracted spatial parameters allow the whole
		arsenal of audio engineering tools for perceptual sound spatialization to be
		used optimally for a variety of target setups, such as appropriate panning
		functions, head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), and reverberation
		algorithms.

	abstract     = {
		Lately, a number of audio players based on web technology have made it
		possible for researchers to present their audio-related work in an attractive
		manner. Tools such as "wavesurfer.js", "waveform-playlist" and
		"trackswitch.js" provide highly-configurable players, allowing a more
		interactive exploration of scientific results that goes beyond simple linear
		playback. However, the audio output to be presented is in many cases not
		generated by the same web technologies. The process of preparing audio data
		for display therefore requires manual intervention, in order to bridge the
		resulting gap between programming languages. While this is acceptable for
		one-time events, such as the preparation of final results, it prevents the
		usage of such players during the iterative development cycle. Having access
		to rich audio players already during development would allow researchers to
		get more instantaneous feedback. The current workflow consists of repeatedly
		importing audio into a digital audio workstation in order to achieve similar
		capabilities, a repetitive and time-consuming process. In order to address
		these needs, we present "pywebaudioplayer", a Python package that automates
		the generation of code snippets for the each of the three aforementioned web
		audio players. It is aimed at use-cases where audio development in Python is
		combined with web visualisation. Notable examples are "Jupyter Notebook" and
		WSGI-compatible web frameworks such as "Flask" or "Django".

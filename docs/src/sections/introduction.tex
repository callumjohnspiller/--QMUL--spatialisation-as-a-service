\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
\subsection{Project Background}\label{subsec:project-background}
\normalsize

This project has been undertaken as a part of a degree apprenticeship with~\gls{sie}.\
As such, the final year engineering project for this author will consider the business domain of the sponsoring company.

With the release of the~\gls{ps5} in November 2020,~\gls{spatial_audio} technology has come into focus for~\gls{sie} as game developers seek to leverage the~\gls{tempest_3d_audio} espoused by the video game console.
In addition,~\gls{sie} is undergoing a shift to cloud-based infrastructure\footnote{like many other companies relying on web technology~\citep{cc_overview}} across the wider business in order to leverage the cost, flexibility, and reliability benefits that cloud technology affords~\citep{cc_overview}.

With respect to these developments in the business, this project seeks to engage both of these emergent technologies in order to address one of~\gls{sie}\textquotesingle s major~\glspl{sla} with a software solution.

\subsection{Problem Statement}\label{subsec:problem-statement}

The onboarding of~\glspl{pspartner} to the developer and publisher platforms managed by~\gls{sie} has been a targeted area for improvement within the company.
The primary challenge the business has faced in this area has been the reduction of friction in the process of getting~\glspl{pspartner} into the PlayStation ecosystem.

While the~\gls{pspartner} onboarding process has been automated and refined over time, this author argues that the ability for potential~\glspl{pspartner} to engage with and trial PlayStation's spatial audio technology is too restricted.

This project is based upon the hypothesis that, for a user who wishes to experiment with or experience~\gls{spatial_audio}, the barrier for entry is too high.
Engaging with a working demonstration of customisable~\gls{spatial_audio} requires a user to perform a significant amount of preparation on a local machine;
it demands a time commitment and pre-requisite technical knowledge that is far greater than is reasonable for an interested party to quickly evaluate what is possible.

Currently~\glspl{pspartner} who want to experiment with~\gls{tempest_3d_audio} must apply and order a~\gls{ps5} development kit, wait for it to arrive, set it up, then figure out how to engage with the~\glspl{api} provided by~\gls{sie}\textquotesingle s~\gls{devnet}.
This process is time-consuming and not optimal for a~\gls{pspartner} who wishes to get a quick insight into what is possible.

This project proposes an alternative solution where a~\gls{pspartner} who wishes to engage with the~\gls{spatial_audio} paradigm is able to experiment using a familiar audio file of their choosing.
The fact that the system will be accessible through a browser will mean that the~\gls{pspartner} will have much easier access, increasing the overall positive impression of the~\gls{pspartner} platform.

\subsection{Project Aims}\label{subsec:aims}

The primary aim of this project is to research, design, and engineer a web service that allows a user to easily experience~\gls{spatial_audio} in a way that reacts to their input.

The proposed workflow would allow a user to use a standard web browser\footnote{The project will most likely be designed for interaction through Chromium-based browsers and Firefox} to upload an audio file to a webpage and then receive back a new audio file that has rendered the stems from the original file into a \textquotesingle spatialised\textquotesingle ~format informed by \glspl{hrtf}.
All the audio processing would execute in \gls{aws} cloud environments to circumvent any real-world hardware requirements and challenges.

For vital information security reasons, the prototype produced as a part of this project will not feature any proprietary~\gls{sie} software and instead use only libraries that exist in the public domain.
As such, this prototype can be considered a~\gls{poc} where, if successful,~\gls{sie} software might be transplanted into the serverless pipeline.

\subsection{Project Objectives}\label{subsec:project-objectives}

In order to achieve the aims set out in Section~\ref{subsec:aims} the project must produce a number of deliverables:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A project plan which outlines the timeline of both the research and development of the project
    \item A review of pertinent literature relating primarily to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Audio spatialisation
        \item Web audio \glspl{api}
        \item Cloud infrastructure (including those available from \gls{aws})
    \end{itemize}
    \item A review of existing stereo-to-spatial services and technologies.
    \item A functioning stereo-to-spatial serverless pipeline.
    \item A frontend that enables a user to interact with the conversion pipeline by uploading and downloading audio files, as well as setting parameters for conversion through a web~\gls{api}.
    \item A testing framework that supports iterative development.
    \item A report on user testing, including feedback from stakeholders.
    \item A review and analysis of how the produced system has met or missed the targets.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Research Questions}\label{subsec:research-questions}

In order to guide the research and development process of the proposed system, this report will seek to answer the following research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Who might be interested in experiencing spatial audio, how might they do it, and why?
    \item How is spatial audio rendered?
    \item What are the existing ways in which spatial audio can be experienced, and how accessible are they?
    \item Starting with a standard music file, what is the best way to demonstrate the capabilities of spatial audio rendering?
    \item How can intensive audio processing be performed in cloud environments?
    \item How might audio that is rendered in the cloud be delivered efficiently back to a web front-end?

\end{enumerate}

Thankfully this project met a lot of the requirements, even the ones found after user testing.

However improvements could be made to the cold starts of the cloud rendering
Initial separation of stems takes a long time because of cold starts and a way to reduce this would be most important could also add a load bar to track the progress of the lambda function would go a long way to I creasing user experience metrics

Demonstrate the capabilities of 3d toolkit better - allow changing of HRTF and BRIR profiles to the users tastes - this could be reflected in the 3d model also - it's good for basic demo but going a bit further would be great

Finally; improve UI further - make more detailed and precise.

\section{Risk Assessment}\label{sec:risk-assessment}

\normalsize

A risk is defined by the~\citet{pmi_2021} as~\textquote{an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, can have a positive or negative effect on one or more objectives}~\footnote{\citep{pmi_2021}}.
The effective management of project risk across a number of risk-management frameworks involves the prior identification of said risks~\citep{goman_risk}.
For this project, a risk assessment is performed across three categories as a means of improving the likelihood of the project meeting its objectives as laid out in~\ref{subsec:project-objectives}.

This assessment takes the form of three tabular risk registers with columns evaluating each risk's impact and likelihood, as well as preventative actions taken as a result of this identification.
These risks will be subject to ongoing monitoring, and are subject to change over the duration of the project's completion.

\subsection{Project Risks}\label{subsec:project-risks}

These risks affect the project’s schedule and affect the project’s ability to be finished within a given timeframe.

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{szssz}
    \caption{Project Risks}\label{tab:project-risks}\\
    \toprule
    \textbf{Risk} & \textbf{Impact} & \textbf{Likelihood rating} & \textbf{Impact rating} & \textbf{Preventative actions}\\\midrule
    Failure to access required information & Lack full understanding of the background material & Low & Medium & Be diligent in identifying alternative sources, as well as making use of the Queen Mary Library’s resource-purchasing facility\\\midrule
    Scope creep & During development the scope of the project may increase and what is attempted goes beyond what is realistically capable over the duration of the project & Medium & Low & Clearly define the scope at the outset of the project, have a roadmap in place and be accountable for sticking to it\\\midrule
    Low productivity & When work on projects slow, any delays can cascade and cause the project to miss its objectives by the end of the project duration & Medium & Medium & Be diligent in creating and sticking to a project plan\textemdash additionally communicate frequently with the project supervisor in order to be accountable and to resolve any issues promptly\\\midrule
    Lose access to~\gls{aws} & Given that the project is hosted in the cloud, losing access to administrate the service would result in a severe delay in development & Low & High & Make sure that all credentials are up to date before starting development\textemdash check company policy surrounding credential expiry\\\midrule
    Loss of work & If the codebase is lost during development then this means having to re-write all of the code, slowing down the project dramatically & Low & Medium to High & Ensure that codebase management systems are used\textemdash this means using a version-control system such as GitHub to store all code and documentation for the project\textemdash also ensure that any~\gls{aws} deployments have backups\\\midrule
    Inefficient working & When time is spent on menial, small, or administrative tasks that do not directly contribute to the project's completion, this can cause progress on the overall project to slow & High & Medium & Ensure that tasks are prioritised effectively, deploying agile scrum effort ratings when needed\\\midrule
    Lacking requisite skills & When a challenge in the project requires skills that the development team does not possess then they must spend time learning the skills required to overcome the challenge\textemdash this can slow progress on the project & Medium & Medium & When planning the project timeline, ensure that enough leeway has been granted to tasks to allow for extra time spent on learning and development\\\midrule
    Unexpected levels of complexity & Only when projects are begun do certain challenges arise\textemdash the project may become far more complex and disorganised than originally planned & Medium & Low & As well as planning effectively, the development team can ensure that they are diligent when it comes to researching the technologies they use\textemdash this means that they are able to develop the project effectively\\\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Product Risks}\label{subsec:product-risks}

These risks pose threats to the quality, or performance of the prototype.

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{szssz}
    \caption{Product Risks}\label{tab:product-risks}\\
    \toprule
    \textbf{Risk} & \textbf{Impact} & \textbf{Likelihood rating} & \textbf{Impact rating} & \textbf{Preventative actions}\\\midrule
    Insufficient prototype testing & The product does not meet functional and non-functional requirements & Medium & High & Specify a framework for testing as soon as possible in the development process, automate testing where possible using a~\gls{ci} pipeline\\\midrule
    \gls{aws} instability & In the event of the cloud hosting and processing services going down, the product's service will be unavailable & Low & High & Make use of different availability zones within~\gls{aws} so that in the event of failure in a single area, the project can be spun up again elsewhere\\\midrule
    Code issues & If the project contains code that lacks quality, then bugs and unstable performance may cause the product to fail & Medium & High & Conform to best-practice coding standards, frequently test code in regression and unit tests, ensure any bugs are promptly patched\\\midrule
    Insufficient research & When a product is made without properly researching the best methods to do so, that product can be insufficient in comparison to competition in a business environment & Low & Medium & Ensure that enough time is scheduled to experimenting with different technology and researching pertinent literature before proceeding with development\\\midrule
    Poor design & If the product has been badly designed then it will not meet the desired level of quality and user requirements\textemdash the product may even fail to work at all & Medium & Medium & Ensure that sufficient time has been given to the planning stage\textemdash in the event that unforeseen problems come to light ensure that help is sought to resolve the design issue and re-build if necessary\\\midrule
    Poor project management & If the project is managed poorly then the product may not be built to a satisfactory level\textemdash delays and lack of proper oversight can cause a drop in the quality of the delivered product & Low & Medium & Ensure that the project management software is correctly set up\textemdash use alerts for deadlines and make an effort to work on the project often\\\midrule
    Unrealistic project goals & If the targeted~\gls{mvp} is not of appropriate scope then the product might not get finished in time for the project deadline in the event that there is too much work to do & Low & High & Work in an agile and iterative fashion\textemdash start small on tasks and gradually build up complexity\\\midrule
    Insufficient resources & If the project does not get the compute power or cloud resources it needs then the product's performance will be lacking or it may not function at all & Low & Medium & Have a clear outline as to what resources are needed and allow enough time to get the requisite permission from the company's~\gls{aws} administrators\\\bottomrule

\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Business Risks}\label{subsec:business-risks}
This project is undertaken as a part of a degree apprenticeship and associated business risks are present:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{szssz}
    \caption{Business Risks}\label{tab:business-risks}\\
    \toprule
    \textbf{Risk} & \textbf{Impact} & \textbf{Likelihood rating} & \textbf{Impact rating} & \textbf{Preventative actions} \\\midrule
    Unauthorised use of proprietary materials & Business-critical materials are leaked and cost~\gls{sie} competitive advantage & Low & Critical & Never use any material developed by~\gls{sie} as a part of business activity, use only open-source libraries\\\midrule
    Large~\gls{aws} fees & The project causes cloud fees charged to~\gls{sie} to spiral out of control, costing the company far more than budgeted for & Medium & Medium & Make proper use of the~\gls{aws} cost centre, define a budget, and set limits and alerts for budget usage in the~\gls{aws} console\\\midrule
    Cyber-security attack & In the event that the cloud app has a security vulnerability, the rest of the~\gls{sie} tech stack may be at risk of being compromised & High & High & Utilise domain allow-listing, parameterization of user credentials, and routinely check the vulnerabilities of external dependencies\textemdash additionally, develop a breach response plan\\\midrule
    Data mishandling & In the event that the product stores user data that it does not have permission to, then the company may be liable for severe penalties under the~\gls{gdpr}\footnote{\Citet{powers_supervisory_authorities}} & Low & High & Keep stored user data to a minimum\textemdash in the case that user data is required, ensure that it is handled and disposed correctly, obtaining permission to do so\\\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

Forming part of a degree apprenticeship classification, this paper investigates the efficacy of public cloud infrastructure in meeting business goals and service-level agreements through the design and development of web applications.
A proof-of-concept spatial audio processing pipeline is developed and deployed in a public cloud environment.
This paper documents and assesses these activities.

The rationale behind this paper derives from the sponsoring company,~\gls{sie}, and their business goals.
The application developed as a part of the project attempts to address the problem of accessibility to spatial audio technology;
and improve the ability of~\gls{sie}'s customers to preview technology offered by their~\gls{ps5} console.

A literature review is conducted and covers topics of spatial audio, cloud infrastructure, and web technology.
A project timeline is planned, executed, and an analysis of the project's successes and failures takes place.

The project finds success in moving compute-heavy audio processing tasks into the public cloud and circumventing restrictive hardware requirements for experiencing spatial audio.
This paper also details the various challenges and issues with developing in the public cloud, in addition to the strengths and shortfalls of the project's execution.

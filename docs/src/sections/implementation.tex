-- start small, project timeline aimed to reach MVP then refine - minimum requirements clearly defined, frontend not a priority
-- AWS threw up a few challenges - workflow consisted of working until a problem then consulting documentation for assistance
-- ci/Cd using aws amplify and GitHub integration. Combined with playwright unit tests for frontend and end-to-end tests in backend
-- made multiple branches and builds for testing purposes. Used a separate branch for developing and another to send out for user testing
-- recursive lambda function incident - called itself and resulted in a large bill which I needed to speak to customer service to get resolved
-- after results of user testing I needed to refine the product. Front end component was missing - much more time needed to be put into react.js, MUI and playwrights test writing to accommodate new react components at the unit test level
-- not so much feature creep than lack of time for proposed complexity - desired features required much more learning than previously thought, especially in docker builds and cmake structures
-- local builds proved difficult for Dev purposes, often had to wait for docker images to be built and uploaded and changes to react to be built and deployed using amplify, lots of dev time eaten up waiting

-- code refactor and documentation towards end to maximise readability

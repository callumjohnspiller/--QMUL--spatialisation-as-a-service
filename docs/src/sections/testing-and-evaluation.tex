Testing was a continuous process. Given the nature of the cloud environment things needed to be deployed in an environment so they could be tested.

This is why CI/CD was used.
Commits and pushes to AWS
triggered redeployments and the ability
to test changes in a cloud environment quickly in addition to running regression tests each time.

Manual testing was required to ensure functionality was there but user testing was also used.
A form and a link to an early build of the product were sent out and responses collected. These responses helped assess the effectiveness of the products functionality and guide future development processes.

Product was a success in not only delivering intended functionality but also extending it beyond the static spatial rendering but also preview the spatial audio in a real-time environment.
Front end was far more in depth after refinement
